# JobnetTextAnalysis
Conducting Text Analysis on the retrieve documents from jobnet
Initially an LDA was performed on the 800 documents but not much information of use was extracted.

If our goal is to figure out some of the more desired skills related to data science a different approach could be to have a
dictionary containing keywords and then simply counting the frequency of those words.

Just a small sample of the frequency of some of keywords and their occurrences : 

statistics 49,

databaser 55,

logistics 67,

excellence 76 ( this is here because 'excel' was mentioned as a key word ) ,

azure 78,

programming 80,

excel 115,

analytics 130,
