# JobnetTextAnalysis
Conducting Text Analysis on the retrieved documents from jobnet. The goal was to quantify the skills needed to excel within the field of data-science. An LDA was performed on the 800 documents. The insights of the LDA were not very insightful so a different approach was taken. Along with the LDA, a dictionary of words related to data-science was used, and the frequency of each word was counted.

Just a small sample of the frequency of some of keywords and their occurrences : 

statistics 49,

databaser 55,

logistics 67,

excellence 76 ( this is here because 'excel' was mentioned as a key word ) ,

azure 78,

programming 80,

excel 115,
